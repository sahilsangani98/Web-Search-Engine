OUR BOT Cheat Sheets for AI, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Big Data The Most Complete List of Best AI Cheat Sheets Stefan Kojouharov Follow Jul 9, 2017 · 7 min read Over the past few months, I have been collecting AI cheat sheets. From time to time I share them with friends and colleagues and recently I have been getting asked a lot, so I decided to organize and share the entire collection. To make things more interesting and give context, I added descriptions and/or excerpts for each major topic. This is the most complete list and the Big-O is at the very end, enjoy… >>> Update: We have recently redesigned these cheat sheets into a Super High Definition PDF. Check them out below: Downloadable: Cheat Sheets for AI, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Data Science… Downloadable PDF of Best AI Cheat Sheets in Super High Definition becominghuman.ai Neural Networks Neural Networks Cheat Sheet >>> If you like this list, you can let me know here.<<< Neural Networks Graphs Neural Networks Graphs Cheat Sheet Neural Network Cheat Sheet Ultimate Guide to Leveraging NLP & Machine Learning for your Chatbot Code Snippets and Github Included chatbotslife.com Machine Learning Overview Machine Learning Cheat Sheet Machine Learning: Scikit-learn algorithm This machine learning cheat sheet will help you find the right estimator for the job which is the most difficult part. The flowchart will help you check the documentation and rough guide of each estimator that will help you to know more about the problems and how to solve it. Machine Learning Cheat Sheet Scikit-Learn Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. Scikit-Learn Cheat Sheet MACHINE LEARNING : ALGORITHM CHEAT SHEET This machine learning cheat sheet from Microsoft Azure will help you choose the appropriate machine learning algorithms for your predictive analytics solution. First, the cheat sheet will asks you about the data nature and then suggests the best algorithm for the job.

Chollet explained that Keras was conceived to be an interface rather than an end-to-end machine-learning framework. It presents a higher-level, more intuitive set of abstractions that make it easy to configure neural networks regardless of the backend scientific computing library. Keras Cheat Sheet Numpy NumPy targets the CPython reference implementation of Python, which is a non-optimizing bytecode interpreter. Mathematical algorithms written for this version of Python often run much slower than compiled equivalents. NumPy address the slowness problem partly by providing multidimensional arrays and functions and operators that operate efficiently on arrays, requiring rewriting some code, mostly inner loops using NumPy. Numpy Cheat Sheet Pandas The name ‘Pandas’ is derived from the term “panel data”, an econometrics term for multidimensional structured data sets. Pandas Cheat Sheet Data Wrangling The term “data wrangler” is starting to infiltrate pop culture. In the 2017 movie Kong: Skull Island, one of the characters, played by actor Marc Evan Jackson is introduced as “Steve Woodward, our data wrangler”.

This NumPy stack has similar users to other applications such as MATLAB, GNU Octave, and Scilab. The NumPy stack is also sometimes referred to as the SciPy stack.[3] Scipy Cheat Sheet Matplotlib matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+. There is also a procedural “pylab” interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged.[2] SciPy makes use of matplotlib. pyplot is a matplotlib module which provides a MATLAB-like interface.[6] matplotlib is designed to be as usable as MATLAB, with the ability to use Python, with the advantage that it is free.
