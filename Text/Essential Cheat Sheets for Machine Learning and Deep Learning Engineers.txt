Essential Cheat Sheets for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Engineers Sign in Get started Startups Venture Capital Technology Growth About & Editors Desk Submit Content Essential Cheat Sheets for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Engineers Kailash Ahirwar Follow May 28, 2017 · 4 min read Machine learning is complex. For newbies, starting to learn machine learning can be painful if they don’t have right resources to learn from. Most of the machine learning libraries are difficult to understand and learning curve can be a bit frustrating. I am creating a repository on Github(cheatsheets-ai) containing cheatsheets for different machine learning frameworks, gathered from different sources. Do visit the Github repository, also, contribute cheat sheets if you have any. Thanks. List of Cheatsheets: 1. Keras 2. Numpy 3. Pandas 4. Scipy 5. Matplotlib 6. Scikit-learn 7. Neural Networks Zoo 8. ggplot2 9. PySpark 10. R Studio 11. Jupyter Notebook 12. Dask Keras Source — https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/keras-cheat-sheet#gs.DRKeNMs 2.

If you want to get into contact, you can reach out to me at ahikailash1@gmail.com About Me: I am a Co-Founder of MateLabs, where we have built Mateverse, an ML Platform which enables everyone to easily build and train Machine Learning Models, without writing a single line of code. Note: Recently, I published a book on GANs titled “Generative Adversarial Networks Projects”, in which I covered most of the widely popular GAN architectures and their implementations. DCGAN, StackGAN, CycleGAN, Pix2pix, Age-cGAN, and 3D-GAN have been covered in details at the implementation level. Each architecture has a chapter dedicated to it. I have explained these networks in a very simple and descriptive language using Keras framework with Tensorflow backend.
