30 Amazing Machine Learning Projects for the Past Year (v.2018) Sign in Get started Web Development Data Science Design Business 30 Amazing Machine Learning Projects for the Past Year (v.2018) Mybridge Follow Jan 5, 2018 · 6 min read For the past year, we’ve compared nearly 8,800 open source Machine Learning projects to pick Top 30 (0.3% chance). This is an extremely competitive list and it carefully picks the best open source Machine Learning libraries, datasets and apps published between January and December 2017. Mybridge AI evaluates the quality by considering popularity, engagement and recency. To give you an idea about the quality, the average number of Github stars is 3,558. Python Projects of the Year (avg. 3,707 ??): Here (0 duplicate) Machine Learning Open Source Tools & Projects of the Year v.2019: Here Machine Learning Articles of the Year v.2019: Here Open source projects can be useful for data scientists. You can learn by reading the source code and build something on top of the existing projects. Give a plenty of time to play around with Machine Learning projects you may have missed for the past year. <Recommended Learning> A) Neural Networks Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks [68,745 recommends, 4.5/5 stars] B) TensorFlow Complete Guide to TensorFlow for Deep Learning with Python [17,834 recommends, 4.6/5 stars] <Others> A) Web hosting: Get free domain name for a year.
