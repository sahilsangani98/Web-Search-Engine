Medium is truly where ideas are born, shared, and spread. Jasmine Bina I think writers should work for readers instead of advertisers, so I’m voting with my credit card. I happily pay for products I love. Writing is no exception. Andrew Courter I love Medium’s membership — it gives me access to the stories I love by the writers I love, and it allows me to help support those writers financially.
